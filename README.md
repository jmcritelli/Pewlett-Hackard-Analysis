# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis  
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to do build a database to complete employee research to find out who will be retiring and how many people will Pewlett-Hackard need hire after the retiring people are no longer with the company. We will also be generating lists to find out who all will be eligible for the retirement package.
## Results: 
### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed. 
o	1,941 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

o	There are more senior engineers eligible for retirement (29,414) than any other job title but only 611 of the4m are eligible for the mentorship program. 


## Summary: 
### Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

-Approximately 90,399 roles will need to be filled as employees start retiring. 

o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?

-I believe this would depend on how they plan to do the mentorship program. Letâ€™s say a relatively even number of employees were going to be retire every year over the course of the next 4 years (roughly 22,600 a year). If all 1,941 stay on with the company that would average out to about each of them have 12 mentees a year. If they were to do new hire classes every 3 months and then after training hand them over to the mentors, they could get 3 solid months of mentoring in with the new hire after initial training. If they plan on taking this route, yes, there will be enough senior employees from that point of view. Of course this would all depend on number of people hired and/or needed for each dept.
